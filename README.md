## Mission objectives
At the end of this challenge you should have improved your:
* JavaScript skills
* team skills
* git conflict skills

## The Mission
This challenge will have you create a [cookie clicker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cookie_Clicker) as a team. Follow the instructions to complete the challenge, to get some ideas check the examples in the resources section.

Must-have features / Instructions
> **Note** The steps below are meant to help you in development, but as long as you make a cookie clicker you can implement whatever you want.

- [x] Step 1: base structure<br>
Write the base structure for the project in *HTML*, *CSS* and *JavaScript*. Within the HTML, put a *click* button which will increment a counter and a label initialised at *0* to display said counter.

- [x] Step 2: prepare the JavaScript<br>
In your JavaScript prepare variables to allow you to control your button and label. You will also need a variable to keep track of the score.

- [x] Step 3: increase the score<br>
When you click the button, increase the variable storing the score by *1*, then display the current score inside the label.

- [x] Step 4: make a multiplier<br>
Add another button which will act as a multiplier. When called this button will permanently multiply the number of points per click, by *two* for example.

- [x] Step 5: price of multiplier<br>
The multiplier allows you to have a big score quickly, that shouldn’t be free, it should be a purchase made with the current player score.

- [x] Step 6: no credit<br>
You can’t make credit, meaning that the player cannot have a negative score. Think about updating the score display after a purchase.

- [x] Step 7: display multiplier counter<br>
Display the counter within the multiplier. For example, if the counter is worth 5, then the button should display something like *multiplier x5*.

- [x] Step 8: increase the cost<br>
Buying a lot of multiplier is way too easy. For more fun, make it so that each time a multiplier is purchased the cost of buying a new one is increased.

- [x] Step 9: display the cost<br>
In the text of the multiplier button you should also have the price of the upgrade.

- [x] Step 10: auto-clicker<br>
Implement a new improvement to buy, the *auto-click*. As the name might suggest this bonus will automatically add a click to your score each *x* seconds.

- [x] Step 11: bonus<br>
Implement yet another improvement to buy, the *bonus*. It should grant the player a boost in score of *200%* per click for *30 seconds*. When purchased the player should see a timer with the remaining time inside the bonus button.

- [x] Step 12: deactivate the buttons<br>
Make it so that, if the player doesn’t have the points to purchase a multiplier, an auto-click or an other bonus, he can’t.

- [x] Step 13: make it pretty<br>
Your cookie clicker must be pretty, make it look good with CSS or some extra JavaScript.

## Deliverables
1. Publish your source code on the GitHub repository.
2. Pimp up the readme file:
  * What, Why, When, How, Who.
  * Pending things to do
  * It must contain a link to the "live" version. The "live" version must contain a link to the source code on GitHub.
3. Publish the link to the "live" version on Discord.

Steps
1. Create the repository
2. Study the request (What & Why ?)
3. Identify technical challenges (How ?)
4. UX Prototype ...
